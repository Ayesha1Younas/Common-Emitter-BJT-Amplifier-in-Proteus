# Common-Emitter-BJT-Amplifier-in-Proteus
Circuit of Common Emitter BJT Amplifier in Proteus 
In this project, the Emitter terminal of BJT is used as a common terminal to collector and Base both. The amplification occures in this way. The circuit is simple and demonstrative. You can check other circuits at www.thehengineeringprojects.com .
